Hark is my solo project. I have a wide range of influences: power and progressive metal, prog rock, jazz fusion, early electronic music, classical, anything from the 80s and the darker side of synthwave.

I plan to bring a darker, heavier sound to some familiar tunes. I also plan on enlisting the help of some guest musicians and vocalists on most songs.

I grew up learning piano and clarinet, mostly classical music. My younger brother and one of my high school friends introduced me to heavy metal, but at that point in my life I was purely a listener. During and after university I gave up music for a while, but in 2017 I decided to get back into music again and I bought a synthesizer instead of a more traditional keyboard. I had realized that I gravitated more to synth sounds than piano and wanted to try my hand at playing like some of my heroes in the genres listed earlier.

More recently I discovered the worlds of synthwave and darksynth. The latter aligns with my musical taste and due to its more experimental nature allows me to blend in some of my other influences. It's currently the ideal style for me to express myself.

This is very much a hobby for me - I have a career in software - but I do aim to release several songs each year. Hope you enjoy listening!
