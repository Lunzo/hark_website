I'm pleased to announce the release of my singles Electric Cafe and Switch On to all streaming services. A music video for Electric Cafe is on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/z-X8mNWKPXs) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hark.fun/videos/3847986595454898). Follow the social media or music links above to access.

[Electric Cafe](https://open.spotify.com/album/4H1rXeXxoLQEj1dtY3Ub1t) is a cover of a Kraftwerk song. I was initially going to just do it as a video for social media but decided I liked it enough to release as a finished song. It's now available on all streaming services.

[Switch On](https://open.spotify.com/album/50BO2DoU9FeVhNcgWQrwWL) is my take at turning JS Bach's Badinerie from Suite No. 2 in B Minor into a synthwave track. Originally the whole song had the more aggressive lead sound. I replaced the aggressive lead with a more mellow take for the 3rd quarter of the song to add some contrast. Once I did that, I decided to make a remix where the whole thing song is more mellow. 

I hope you enjoy listening to both songs.
