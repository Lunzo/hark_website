You may be wondering why I'm using a novelty top level domain like .fun for my website. There were a couple of .com options that could have worked, but none were as short or as catchy as this domain. 

Fun is important to me. Having fun and making sure others are too is one of my values. I believe music ought to be fun. I think it's no accident that the verb for music is "to play"!
